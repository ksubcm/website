<h1>Fundraising</h1>

<hr>
<p>Each year we decide on a monetary amount to raise that will support missions. While our goal is to continue to surpass our financial goals, BCM ultimately desires to advance the kingdom of God and to meet the needs of others through missions.</p>

<h1>Send Me Now</h1>

<h1>What We've Done in Missions</h1>

<hr>
<p>Throughout the years the KSU-SPSU BCM has been involved in many local mission trips around the Atlanta area. Just a few of the places we helped serve during Spring Break 2013 were GCSU, UGA, and the University of North Georgia. We are always looking for new opportunities to support missions and are excited about what God is doing in the Atlanta area and around the world. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding missions or know of an area you would like to see met in our community.</p>

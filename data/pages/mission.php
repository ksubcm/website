Just a few of the places we helped serve during Spring Break 2013 were GCSU, UGA, and the University of North Georgia. We are always looking for new opportunities to support missions and are excited about what God is doing in the Atlanta area and around the world. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding missions or know of an area you would like to see met in our community.</p></div><hr><div class="row"><h1>Send Me Now. a great opportunity for every student.</h1><p>Send Me Now is a missions organization that helps students engage in mission trips in Georgia, the United States, and all over the world.

		KSU-SPSU BCM aims to advance the kingdom of God on our campuses and in our
		community. To do this we gather together for mission trips as well as raising
		funds for our Send Me Now summer missionaries. We would love for you to join us
		this year as we serve others, check our <a href="main.php?pageid=events">events
		page </a>for upcoming mission trips. Each year our missions team sets a
		fundraising goal to fund our summary missionaries. If you would like to donate,
		or help us in providing free mission trips for those who are willing to go
		please <a href="main.php?pageid=contactus">contact us	</a>.

<p>We desire to impact the community around us through our local outreach projects. We partner with local organizations and churches to reach and serve those who are in need around us. Past projects we have been involved in include: <a href="http://www.booksforafrica.org/">Books for Africa</a>, visiting <a href="http://rossmemorial.com/">Ross Memorial Nursing Home</a>, hosting a block party at Sedgefield Apartment homes, assisting at Camino de Vida Kid Zone and English classes, and being involved in <a href="http://www.handsonatlanta.org/Mission_and_Values">Hands on Atlanta </a>at Hollydale Elementary School.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serving others in the community is a great way to get to know those in our community as well as each other. We always have plenty of community service opportunities. Stay tuned for more service projects coming up on our events page, and feel free to come serve with us when you can!</p>

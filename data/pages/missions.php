			KSU-SPSU BCM aims to advance the kingdom of God on our campuses and in our

			this year as we serve others, check our events page for upcoming mission trips.
			Each year our missions team sets a fundraising goal to fund our summary
			missionaries. If you would like to donate, or help us in providing free mission
			trips for those who are willing to go please contact us.

The Missions Leadership Team facilitates BCM in efforts to advance the kingdom of God within BCM, on campus and in the community. Those involved in mission projects come together to raise support, financially and prayerfully, for Send Me Now missionaries and are involved in BCM mission trips. 
Each year we decide on a monetary amount to raise that will support missions. While our goal is to continue to surpass our financial goals, BCM ultimately desires to advance the kingdom of God and to meet the needs of others through missions.  
	Send Me Now is a missions organization that helps students engage in mission trips in Georgia, the United States, and all over the world. To find out more about Send Me Now and to check for mission opportunities, visit their website at http://sendmenow.net/. 
	Throughout the years the KSU-SPSU BCM has been involved in many local mission
trips around the Atlanta area. Just a few of the places we helped serve during
Spring Break 2013 were GCSU, UGA, and the University of North Georgia. We are
always looking for new opportunities to support missions and are excited about
what God is doing in the Atlanta area and around the world. Please contact us if
you have any questions regarding missions or know of an area you would like to
see met in our community.

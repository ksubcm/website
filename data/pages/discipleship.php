		<h1>Why Discipleship</h1>
		<p>Discipleship begins as we enter into fellowship with Christ. It is the act of "doing life" with one another and investing in each others lives so that we might be closer in fellowship with Christ. Here, at KSU BCM we have a heart for the Lord and to see our friends, family, coworkers and colleagues know Jesus and his Word. We strive to go beyond friendship with each other and form life long friendships with each other through discipleship.</p>
		<p>Throughout the week we hold fellowship groups. We would love for you to come and be apart of our weekly fellowship groups as we study the Bible and enjoy times of spiritual growth. Checkout our current Bible study times below.</p>

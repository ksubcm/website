<h2>Who Are We?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>KSU-SPSU Baptist Collegiate Ministries (BCM) is a student led organization on the campuses of Kennesaw State University and Southern Polytechnic State University that serves local college students and young adults. Our mission is to be dedicated to glorifying God though discipleship. This means through small groups, worship gatherings, and fellowship.</p>

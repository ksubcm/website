Dave Stewart is our campus minister! Dave has served the campuses of Kennesaw
State for 18 years (after being a rocket scientist and pastor). Dave is here to
help us college folk in any way possible. Mrs. Juddy Stewart is Dave's beloved
wife. She is Dave's wing man and loves to serve the BCM from afar with her most
excellent cooking! Both Dave and Juddy loves to have guests at their home and
are welcome anytime (just give them a heads up about a week in advance).

If are new to the area, need advice on anything, or just need someone to talk to
Dave is here for you! Dave's office is at the BCM building on the south campus
of KSU. He's there from 10am to 4pm Monday through Friday.

<p>
Katie Robertson is our campus minister intern. Essentially she is Dave when Dave
is not around. From driving students to events and helping organize them she has
been a great servant to our campus. Katie joined our BCM family this past fall
semester after being an elementary school teacher. We hope you get to know Katie
and enjoy her friendship as we have!

<p>
The BCM building is located on the south KSU campus at 1100 South Marietta Pkwy.
It has been a home, worship gathering place, and student center for countless
years. This is where Dave's office is as well as our Wednesday lunches. The BCM
building is open from 10am to 5pm Monday through Friday (or if an authorized
person is keeping the building open). There are two entrances to the building.
One is the main entrance at the front of the building and the other is a side
door which faces the parking lot. If one is closed please try the other.

<p>" make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves; do not <em>merely</em> look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus" Phil 2:3-5</p>

<p>Our worship team at BCM desires to give God all the glory, honor, and praise He deserves by leading others to His presence through praise and worship. We desire to continue to fulfill the calling of this scripture by worshiping the Lord with humility, passion, and intimacy- and leading others to do the same.</p>

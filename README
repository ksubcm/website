FORMAT OF PAGE FILE
===================
Each page for the website should be located at data/pages/ and should be a .php
file. Each php file is actually a configuration file for that page. They should
be formatted as follows: 

Copy and paste this into a new file in /data/pages/<new-page-name>.php to create
a new page.

  <?php
  $page['TITLE'] = "Title of Page Goes here";
	$page['SUBTITLE'] = "subtitle of page if title exists";
	$page['CONTENT'] = "all of the html you can desire goes here. This text
		string is the actual html that gets inserted as the content of the page.
    This line can span up to infitely number of lines";
	?><!-- DO NOT PUT ANYTHING PAST THIS POINT IF $page['TITLE'] != NULL 
         OR YOU WILL GET PAGE CONTENT ABOVE THE TITLE BAR --> 


Any of the above variables can be set to NULL to disable that element of the page (for instance

  $page['TITLE'] = NULL;

removes the title at the top of the page).

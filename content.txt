Missions: Mark 16:15*
====================
Missions Statement
------------------
The Missions Leadership Team facilitates BCM in efforts to advance the kingdom of God within BCM, on campus and in the community. Those involved in mission projects come together to raise support, financially and prayerfully, for Send Me Now missionaries and are involved in BCM mission trips. 

Goals
-----
Each year we decide on a monetary amount to raise that will support missions. While our goal is to continue to surpass our financial goals, BCM ultimately desires to advance the kingdom of God and to meet the needs of others through missions.  

What We Do
----------
Throughout the years the KSU-SPSU BCM has been involved in many local mission trips around the Atlanta area. Just a few of the places we helped serve during Spring Break 2013 were GCSU, UGA, and the University of North Georgia. We are always looking for new opportunities to support missions and are excited about what God is doing in the Atlanta area and around the world. Please contact us if you have any questions regarding missions or know of an area you would like to see met in our community.

Send Me Now
-----------
Send Me Now is a missions organization that helps students engage in mission trips in Georgia, the United States, and all over the world. To find out more about Send Me Now and to check for mission opportunities, visit their website at http://sendmenow.net/. 

Community Service: Gal 5:13
============================
Goal
----
The BCM Community Service Leaders help others reach out to our community by planning and executing acts of service. Overall, our goal is to continue to affect change in the community by serving others and showing them the love of Christ.

What We Do
----------
Past projects we have been involved in include: Books for Africa, visiting Ross Memorial Nursing Home, hosting a block party at Sedgefield Apartment homes, assisting at Camino de Vida Kid Zone and English classes, and being involved in Hands on Atlanta at Hollydale Elementary School.  We always have community service opportunities to get involved in and love getting to know others in the community and in BCM better through service. Stay tuned for more service projects coming up on our events page, and feel free to come serve with us when you can!

Outreach: Matt 28:19
====================

Goal
----
While the goal of BCM missions is to extend the hand of Christ from our campuses, our outreach group is dedicated to serving our campuses and community in Christ, in hopes that all may know the gospel and come to be saved. 

On Campus
---------
Our purpose is to influence the campus community by being on campus during our college career- and specifically during outreach days each semester. During many of these days BCM will partner with a local church and go on campus to minister to students, staff, and faculty nearby. We enjoy handing out free cookies and information about the gospel while and creating conversations and sharing the love of God with those around. This is a great time to show our campus how much BCM cares and that we desire to be the light of Christ in and out of the classroom.

We would love to see you on our campus outreach days and look forward to seeing how God will work through us to reach out to more people on campus! Check our events page to see when we will be on campus next and feel free to contact us with any questions.

In the Community
----------------
As always, we love reaching out to members of the community and are involved with many local missions efforts. To find out more about how we are involved in community outreach, visit our Community Outreach page.

International Student Outreach
------------------------------
The KSU-SPSU BCM has a tradition of being aware and accepting of the international student population on campus. We have met many students on both campuses from countries all over the world including countries from Africa, Europe and Asia. We love sharing Christ with all of our students and have a special heart for those who are away from their native homes. 

BCM continues to coordinate events that invite international students to be integrated in a body of college students who love and care about them. We have gone on rafting trips, ski trips, climbed Stone Mountain and have also had Dinner and Conversation nights at the BCM building. 

Ultimately, our goal is to go beyond introducing international students to an event or a trip- but to build lifelong relationships and establish friendships during our time together.
If you know international students on our campuses or if you are an international student, please know you are always welcome and we look forward to getting to know you! Please contact us or visit our events page to if you have questions or are looking for ways to get involved. 

Worship: Phil 2:3-5
====================

Goal
----
Our worship team at BCM desires to give God all the glory, honor, and praise He deserves by leading others to His presence through praise and worship. 
We desire to continue to fulfill the calling of this scripture by worshiping the Lord with humility, passion, and intimacy- and leading others to do the same. 

What We Do
----------
We would love for you to come join us for our weekly Fusion Worship Services at Kennesaw First Baptist Church where we get to praise God through singing and by opening his word. Other worship events have included Harvest Night last semester at SPSU, which was a night of praise on Halloween night that incorporated the spirit of the Harvest by giving thanks and joining with others. Other worship events will be posted on our events page. If you are interested in helping lead worship or helping to coordinate Fusion (sound, lights, tech) please contact us and we will assist you as soon as we can.

?Fusion: Ps 100:1-2
===================
Fusion is a night where BCM gathers to worship and fellowship with one another. We meet at 8 pm on Tuesday nights at First Baptist Church of Kennesaw and enjoy a message and worship followed by our famous late-night Steak and Shake outing! We would love for you to come join us on Tuesdays and look forward to meeting you soon. For updates about Fusion nights, check out our events page or contact us with any questions.
